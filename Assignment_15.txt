Ans 1:
    F = (a-1)(b+c)
    
Ans 2:
    x = (-0.006)*2.7 + (-2.5)(-8.6) + 1.4*0.002
    x = 21.4336
    
    f(x) = 1/(1+exp(21.4336))
    f(x) = 0.9999999995
    
    if bias, b = -1.1 , then,
    x = 21.4336 + b
    x = 20.3336
    
    f(x) = 1/(1+exp(20.3336))
    f(x) = 0.9999999985
    
    Hence here is the little difference in the results.
    
    Bias : It provides each node with a trainable value. The output not only depend on the inputs but 
           also on the constant value.
